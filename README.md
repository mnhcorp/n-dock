# NeuroDock

**NeuroDock** is an open-source, Docker-based foundation model pre-training platform designed to be modality-agnostic and domain-agnostic. It provides a flexible and extensible system for training and fine-tuning foundation models across any data type (text, images, audio, etc.), all within a fully customizable architecture.

## Features

- **Modality & Domain Agnostic:** Train models on any data type—text, image, audio, and more.
- **Extensible Architecture:** Use pre-built templates (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2) or extend the platform with your own architectures.
- **Docker-based Flexibility:** Easily run on local or cloud GPU infrastructure.
- **Customizable Pre-training:** Full control over architecture, hyperparameters, and training fidelity.
- **API for Data Ingestion and Pre-training:** Simple APIs to ingest data and tweak model training parameters.

### Initial Implementation Features

1. **Basic Data Ingestion:** Support for ingesting image data as a starting point.
2. **Simple Pre-training Configuration:** Easy setup for pre-training a basic CNN model for image classification.
3. **Model Persistence:** Save and load pre-trained models for future use or fine-tuning.
4. **Training Progress Tracking:** Basic logging and progress updates during the pre-training process.
5. **Simple Evaluation:** Implement basic evaluation metrics to assess the pre-trained model's performance.

## Installation

To get started with NeuroDock, ensure you have Docker installed on your machine.

### Step 1: Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/NeuroDock.git
cd NeuroDock
```

### Step 2: Build the Docker image
```bash
docker build -t neurodock .
```

### Step 3: Run NeuroDock
```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 neurodock
```

---

## Quick Start

Here’s a simple example of how to use **NeuroDock** for pre-training a model on a custom dataset.

### Step 1: Ingest Data
Use the `data_ingest` API to load your dataset.
```python
import neurodock

# Example for image data
data_config = {
  "data_type": "image",
  "data_path": "./data/images",
  "image_size": 224
}

neurodock.data_ingest(data_config)
```

### Step 2: Choose a Pre-training Architecture
Select from NeuroDock’s template of pre-training architectures or define your own.
```python
# Pre-training using CLIP for vision-language tasks
pretrain_config = {
  "architecture": "CLIP",
  "modality": "image-text",
  "learning_rate": 0.0001,
  "batch_size": 32,
  "epochs": 10
}

neurodock.pre_train(pretrain_config)
```

### Step 3: Extend with a Custom Architecture
If you want to add your own architecture, follow the extension instructions below.

## API Overview

### Data Ingestion API

NeuroDock simplifies data preprocessing with an easy-to-use ingestion API that handles different data modalities like text, images, and audio.

#### Example Usage
```python
import neurodock

# Image data ingestion
data_config = {
  "data_type": "image",
  "data_path": "./data/images",
  "image_size": 224
}

neurodock.data_ingest(data_config)

# Text data ingestion
text_config = {
  "data_type": "text",
  "data_path": "./data/text",
  "tokenizer": "bert-base-uncased"
}

neurodock.data_ingest(text_config)
```

### Pre-training API

The `pre_train` API allows full customization of model pre-training, enabling users to fine-tune architecture, hyperparameters, and training fidelity.

#### Example Usage

```python
import neurodock

# Using DINOv2 for self-supervised vision tasks
pretrain_config = {
  "architecture": "DINOv2",
  "modality": "image",
  "learning_rate": 0.001,
  "batch_size": 16,
  "epochs": 20
}

neurodock.pre_train(pretrain_config)

# Using CLIP for vision-language tasks
pretrain_config = {
  "architecture": "CLIP",
  "modality": "image-text",
  "learning_rate": 0.0001,
  "batch_size": 32,
  "epochs": 10
}

neurodock.pre_train(pretrain_config)
```

## Extending NeuroDock

You can add your own custom architectures to NeuroDock’s template by creating new architecture classes in the `/models` directory.

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Create a new architecture file** in `/models`.
2. **Define the model** by extending NeuroDock’s `BaseModel` class.
3. **Add your architecture to the pre-training config** so it can be called from the API.

#### Example of Adding a Custom Model
```python
# models/custom_model.py

from neurodock.models.base import BaseModel

class CustomModel(BaseModel):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # Define custom layers here

    def forward(self, x):
        # Forward pass logic here
        pass

# Now add this to the pretrain_config

pretrain_config = {
  "architecture": "CustomModel",
  "modality": "image",
  "learning_rate": 0.001,
  "batch_size": 16,
  "epochs": 20
}

neurodock.pre_train(pretrain_config)
```
